  	This is my github page and I've made this entirely using html. I don't know what it's going to look like but I'm going to try my best to make this look good. In this blog, I'm going to tell you about a lot of stuff so stay tuned and continue reading and reach the end.<br>
  	The image I've put here is the thumbnail of my first youtube video on my channel which has crossed 1k views.<br>
  	Ok let's keep that aside, I'll come to that in a moment. I want to let you know me, before knowing my work. My full name is <b>Atharva Umesh Thotyan</b> and I was born on 21 January 2002 in Madhya Pradesh. I didn't stay there though. I was brought up in Mumbai. Currently I'm studying CSE in <b>Gitam University</b>, vizag which is in Andhra Pradesh. I am studying web development on my own as I'm enjoying it a lot. This page is the result of it. I've completed a basic html course on coursera.

  		This video is basically a monatge of some of my best moments and memories in my university.<br>
  		It includes some scenes from my college which some were shot intentionally or unintentionally. I also anchored a fest in the college and I did include that in the video. Also, there are a lot more clips like the flashmob we had in the campus, the beaches, the gym and many more. I have truly enjoyed my life at the campus.

  	<h2 style="text-align: center;"><b>Motivation</b></h2>
  	<p>
  		I feel that having a strong desire to acheive my goals is what fuels me the most to work without getting bored. I have actually found happiness in being busy aned doing my work as I know that it is going to help me in the future.<br>
  		I would also say that I'm very lucky as I've got the best of friends who are like brothers to me. Each one of them works hard and they know what they want. Seeing them work also motivates me to do more and better in life. We all help each other always which also strengthens our bond.
